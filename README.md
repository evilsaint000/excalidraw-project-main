# Excalidraw Reimagined: A Digital Whiteboard

## Under the Hood: The Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern toolset to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience:

  * **Next.js**: The foundation of our application, providing a powerful React framework for server-rendered and static web apps.
  * **TypeScript (TS)**: Ensures code quality and developer confidence by adding static types to JavaScript.
  * **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and consistent UI development.
  * **Rough.js**: The magic behind the graphics, giving our shapes a unique, sketchy, hand-drawn appearance.
  * **Perfect Freehand**: A specialized library used to render beautifully smooth and natural freehand lines.
  * **Recoil**: Manages the application's state in an efficient and scalable way, straight from the creators of React.

## Functionality Highlights

The application comes packed with a range of features to bring your ideas to life:

  * **Infinite Canvas**: Pan and navigate across a boundless canvas, giving you endless space to create.
  * **Geometric Shapes**: Quickly draw fundamental shapes, including rectangles, circles, and lines.
  * **Object Manipulation**: Effortlessly select and move any element on the canvas.
  * **Pencil Tool**: Sketch your thoughts freely with the intuitive freehand drawing mode.
  * **Visual Styling**: Tailor the look of your creations by modifying stroke thickness, colors, and canvas backgrounds.
  * **Text Tool**: Annotate your drawings by adding and positioning text anywhere you need it.
  * **Dynamic Zoom**: Zoom in to focus on the details or zoom out to see the bigger picture.
